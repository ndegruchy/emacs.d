* Emacs Configuration

This is my personal Emacs configuration that I use across multiple
systems. I've configured it in such a way to allow me a usable
configuration that can be tweaked per-platform.

Most of it should be fairly self-explanatory, as I've taken the time
to redo some of the file layout and give them useful names.

** Packages

   Many of the required packages are not triggered with 'ensure',
   that's because I use Debian, and many of them are in the package
   manager. That means you'll need to get or mark these packages:

     - async :: packaged as elpa-async
     - avy :: packaged as elpa-avy
     - bind-key :: packaged as elpa-bind-key
     - counsel :: packaged as elpa-counsel
     - diminish :: packaged as elpa-diminish
     - editorconfig :: packaged as elpa-editoconfig
     - expand-region :: packaged as elpa-expand-region
     - ivy :: packaged as elpa-ivy
     - markdown-mode :: packaged as elpa-markdown-mode
     - no-littering :: packaged as elpa-no-littering
     - nov :: packaged as elpa-nov
     - olivetti :: packaged elpa-olivetti
     - systemd :: packaged as elpa-systemd
     - web-mode :: packaged as elpa-web-mode
     - which-key :: packaged as elpa-which-key
     - yaml-mode :: packaged as elpa-yaml-mode

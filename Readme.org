* Emacs Configuration

This is my personal Emacs configuration that I use across multiple
systems. I've configured it in such a way to allow me a usable
configuration that can be tweaked per-platform.

Most of it should be fairly self-explanatory, as I've taken the time
to redo some of the file layout and give them useful names.

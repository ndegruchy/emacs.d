	* settings.d/included-packages.el: Unwrap configurations from
	`use-package`. Not really required, as they're included with
	Emacs, and it only adds overhead as it filters through the lisp
	wrapping it.

	* settings.d/custom-keybindings.el ("C-c l"): Modify keybinding to
	use new select function.

	* settings.d/custom-functions.el: Remove
	`ndegruchy/kill-whole-line`. Turns out Emacs already has a
	`kill-whole-line` function. Huh. Remove associated keybinding, too.
	(ndegruchy/select-current-line-dwim): Remove old select line
	function and replace it with this, newer, one that emulates what I
	intend to use it for.

	* settings.d/required-packages.el (magit): Remove `iedit`. I tried
	this and multiple cursors. Not appreciably better than something
	like regexp replace. At least not for my usage.

	* Misc: Fix some keybindings. Going to start using the changelog
	more as Emacs makes it super easy to do so.

	* CHANGELOG: Version 3.0 - Complete overhaul. Removed lots of
	packages and am transitioning to a simpler, lighter and more
	coherent Emacs setup.

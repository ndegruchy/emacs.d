2019-08-17  Nathan DeGruchy  <nathan@degruchy.org>

	* settings.d/: Remove custom platform settings, I don't use much
	in the way of custom settings, so strip all that out, too.

2019-06-23  Nathan DeGruchy  <nathan@degruchy.org>

	* settings.d/custom-hooks.el: Add a custom hook to fix material
	theme with my emacs, as I run it in daemon mode

	* settings.d/general-settings.el (default-frame-alist): Change the
	way the font was defined

	* settings.d/linux-platform-settings.el (material-theme): Change
	to material theme to match my desktop

2019-04-08  Nathan DeGruchy  <nathan@degruchy.org>

	* settings.d/linux-platform-settings.el: Remove dired-atool and
	rsync for lack of use

	* settings.d/general-settings.el: Remove font definition in the
	general settings, changed to per-platform

	* settings.d/linux-platform-settings.el: Add font for linux
	desktop

	* settings.d/macos-platform-settings.el: Remove smex keybinding

2019-03-19  Nathan DeGruchy  <nathan@degruchy.org>

	* settings.d/custom-functions.el (protect-buffers): Protect
	certain buffers

2019-03-16  Nathan DeGruchy  <nathan@degruchy.org>

	* settings.d/linux-platform-settings.el: Add base16 theme back in,
	cleanup font.

2019-03-15  Nathan DeGruchy  <nathan@degruchy.org>

	* settings.d/required-packages.el (rotate): Add package 'rotate',
	to required packages. Allows me to rotate windows around without
	having to manually juggle buffers.

2019-03-13  Nathan DeGruchy  <nathan@degruchy.org>

	* settings.d/linux-platform-settings.el (use-package emms): Re-add
	emms to emacs. I ditched mpd because it wasn't proving as useful
	to me. I use borg to organize music and so I didn't need another
	layer on top of that. Emms -> files -> play in VLC (nox)

2019-02-14  Nathan DeGruchy  <nathan@degruchy.org>

	* settings.d/required-packages.el: Install Helm

2019-02-11  Nathan DeGruchy  <nathan@degruchy.org>

	* settings.d/general-settings.el (delete-by-moving-to-trash): Add
	option to send files to the trash (as specified by the XDG spec)
	instead of straight-up deleting them.

2019-02-06  Nathan DeGruchy  <nathan@degruchy.org>

	* Cleanup: remove old functions and keybindings, finally, actually
	ignore the emacs-customize file.

2019-01-28  Nathan DeGruchy  <nathan@degruchy.org>

	* settings.d/linux-settings.el: Move auctex to this file and put
	it behind an if statement to narrow it's install my desktop, where
	TeXLive will be installed.

	* settings.d/required-packages.el (windresize): Remove some
	packages that I don't tend to use anymore. Not that they're not
	good, I just don't find they get used.

2019-01-19  Nathan DeGruchy  <nathan@degruchy.org>

	* settings.d/included-packages.el: Changed dired to use the ls
	option to group directories first in a listing. What can I say, I
	like it better.

	* ndegruchy/duplicate-line: New function duplicates the current
	line, useful if you need to make a list of directories, or other
	repetitive tasks. C-S-Backspace C-y C-y works, too, but this is
	sexier.

	* YAML-Mode: New package: YAML mode, because all the cool kids
	seem to be using YAML for configuration, so we have this.

2019-01-11  Nathan DeGruchy  <nathan@degruchy.org>

	* EMMS: Added emms to my config so I can play my music from within
	emacs. One more step to full emacs-dom!
	* PDF-tools: Added some shortcuts for annotating in PDFs in
	PDF-tools, that way I can add notes and highlights.

2018-12-22  Nathan DeGruchy  <nathan@degruchy.org>

	* Changes: Some packages removed, some added, a little
	configuration tweaks

2018-12-20  Nathan DeGruchy  <nathan@degruchy.org>

	* Minor-changes: Updated some files.

2018-12-17  Nathan DeGruchy  <nathan@degruchy.org>

	* Midnight-mode: Enable midnight mode for cleaning up buffers when
	I leave my PC on overnight. Actually runs at 04:30, in case I'm up
	late.

	* Dired-hacks: Add a number of dired-hacks files to emacs for cool
	narrowing and filtering in dired.

2018-12-08  Nathan DeGruchy  <nathan@degruchy.org>

	* custom-lisp.d/emacs-customize.el: Remove Magit packages (and
	friends) due to the built in VC being good enough for my purposes.

2018-08-07  Nathan DeGruchy  <nathan@degruchy.org>

	* settings.d/custom-keybindings.el: Add new keymap for
	`avy-goto-char`. Sometimes a word is not enough.

	* settings.d/included-packages.el: Unwrap configurations from
	`use-package`. Not really required, as they're included with
	Emacs, and it only adds overhead as it filters through the lisp
	wrapping it.

	* settings.d/custom-keybindings.el ("C-c l"): Modify keybinding to
	use new select function.

	* settings.d/custom-functions.el: Remove
	`ndegruchy/kill-whole-line`. Turns out Emacs already has a
	`kill-whole-line` function. Huh. Remove associated keybinding, too.
	(ndegruchy/select-current-line-dwim): Remove old select line
	function and replace it with this, newer, one that emulates what I
	intend to use it for.

	* settings.d/required-packages.el (magit): Remove `iedit`. I tried
	this and multiple cursors. Not appreciably better than something
	like regexp replace. At least not for my usage.

	* Misc: Fix some keybindings. Going to start using the changelog
	more as Emacs makes it super easy to do so.

2018-07-09  Nathan DeGruchy  <nathan@degruchy.org>

	* CHANGELOG: Version 3.0 - Complete overhaul. Removed lots of
	packages and am transitioning to a simpler, lighter and more
	coherent Emacs setup.
